I. Objective</a>

<p>
In this project, you will learn how to containerize
services using Docker tools. We will introduce
a few more Docker commands for troubleshooting issues,
as well as Docker Compose to manage and connect
services via container orchestration.
</p>

<hr><a name="compose" class="section">
II. Key-Value Store Orchestration</a>

<p>
We continue our exploration of the key-value store
example from the textbook and focus on the transaction log
backed by a Postgres database in this project.
While the example code from the textbook available from
<a href="https://github.com/cloud-native-go/examples">
github</a> has issues for containerization,
I am able to fix most of them and the updated
version is available at
<a href="https://github.com/wngjia/ece573-prj02.git">
https://github.com/wngjia/ece573-prj02.git</a>.
Similar to Project 1, please create a new VM by importing
our VM Appliance, make a clone of the repository (or fork it first),
and execute 'setup_vm.sh' to setup the VM as needed.
</p>

<p>
Our key-value store consists of two microservices kvs and postgres,
each running in its own container.
The kvs service uses the source code from the textbook that is
in the 'kvs' directory. On the other hand, the postgres service
uses a pre-built Postgres image, which saves us a lot of effort.
Instead of managing this two containers individually, we utilize
Docker Compose to orchestrate the two so that they can be easily
built, started, and stopped as a whole.
</p>

<p>
Docker Compose uses the 'docker-compose.yml' script to define
the services as containers and how they should be orchestrated.
Open docker-compose.yml and you should be able to tell
it defines two services.
The first service is postgres that uses the pre-built image 'postgres:11'.
More details of this image can be found on
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/">docker hub</a>,
including the descriptions for the environment variables defined
in the postgres service.
The second service kvs should be built from the directory 'kvs'.
The port '8080' is publish as '8080' so that we can access
the service inside the container from the VM.
</p>

<p>
What is not shown in the docker-compose.yml script is that
by default Docker Compose will create a private network to
interconnect the containers. Each container will get their own
IP address and will need to know the addresses of others
before they can communicate.
For example, how could the kvs service know the address of
the postgres service? It is definitely not a good idea to hard
code the addresses in the script and in the source code.
Instead, we utilize the DNS service provided by Docker Compose
where each service container has a domain name matching
the name of the service.
We pass 'postgres' via environment varibale to the kvs service
so kvs can use it to connect to the database.
</p>

<p>
Use <span class="command">docker compose build</span> to build
the container image for kvs.
<pre class="console">
ubuntu@ece573:~/ece573-prj02$ docker compose build
...
=> => naming to docker.io/library/ece573-prj02-kvs  0.0s
</pre>
Use <span class="command">docker compose create</span> to create
the containers and the default private network.
<pre class="console">
ubuntu@ece573:~/ece573-prj02$ docker compose create
...
[+] Creating 3/3
 ✔ Network ece573-prj02_default       Created  0.5s 
 ✔ Container ece573-prj02-postgres-1  Created  1.1s 
 ✔ Container ece573-prj02-kvs-1       Created  0.2s
</pre>
Both the commands may take a few minutes to complete
for the first time as they need to pull images from docker hub.
<span class="emph">
Note that you will need to run these two commands again if
you ever change the Go source code in the 'kvs' directory.
</span>

</p>

<p>
Now we are ready to start our key-value store.
Use <span class="command">docker compose start</span> to start
the containers in background.
<pre class="console">
ubuntu@ece573:~/ece573-prj02$ docker compose start
[+] Running 2/2
 ✔ Container ece573-prj02-postgres-1  Started  1.7s 
 ✔ Container ece573-prj02-kvs-1       Started  1.9s
</pre>
Are the containers running? Use <span class="command">docker ps -a</span>
to show all running and stopped containers.
<pre class="console">
buntu@ece573:~/ece573-prj02$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             ...      STATUS            PORTS                        NAMES
4dd8bb77dbdf   ece573-prj02-kvs  ...   Up 29 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp,...   ece573-prj02-kvs-1

</pre>
Pay attention to IMAGE, STATUS, PORTS, and NAMES columns as they indicate
if the containers match your expectations.
</p>

<p>
What if something went wrong and you will need to troubleshoot issues?
Usually a service will generate a lot of log messages on the screen.
However, since we run our containers in background you won't be able to see
those messages directly. To access them, you may use the command
<span class="command">docker logs</span> with the NAME (or the CONTAINER ID) of the container.
<pre class="console">
ubuntu@ece573:~/ece573-prj02$ docker logs 193d
...
2023-09-17 18:02:23.774 UTC [76] LOG:  database system was shut down at 2023-09-17 18:02:23 UTC
2023-09-17 18:02:23.797 UTC [1] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
</pre>
<pre class="console">

</pre>
</p>

<p>
Our key-value store is running and you can use <span class="command">curl</span>
to test it from the VM.
<pre class="console">
ubuntu@ece573:~/ece573-prj02$ curl -X GET 127.0.0.1:8080/v1/a
no such key
ubuntu@ece573:~/ece573-prj02$ curl -X PUT -d "value a" 127.0.0.1:8080/v1/a
ubuntu@ece573:~/ece573-prj02$ curl -X GET 127.0.0.1:8080/v1/a

</pre>
The log messages are also updated.
<pre class="console">
ubuntu@ece573:~/ece573-prj02$ docker logs ece573-prj02-kvs-1

<p>
To complete this section, answer the following questions
in the project report. You may need to perform additional
searches online.
  <ul>
  <li>What is the license of the original example code from the textbook?
  (Hint: read the 'LICENSE' file)</li>
  <li>Open source software may use other licenses like GNU General Public License (GNU GPL)
  and GNU Affero General Public License (GNU AGPL). What are the difference
  between GNU GPL and GNU AGPL for cloud services?</li>
  <li>The kvs service depends on the postgres service as it need to load
  the transaction log from the database. The dependency is defined in
  docker-compose.yml so that postgres starts before kvs.
  However, the log messages above indicate that kvs still need to
  retry connecting to postgres. Why?</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<hr><a name="environment" class="section">
III. Manageability via Environment Variables</a>

<p>
Now you should spend some time reading the Go source code in the 'kvs' directory
to understand how the service works. We have discussed many of them in the lectures
except those in 'pglogger.go', which gives you a few examples on how to connect and
use a SQL database.
</p>

<p>
If you take a look at the 'initializeTransactionLog' function in 'service.go',
you will see the database connection parameters like user and password
are hard coded. This is definitely not acceptable for manageability
as discussed in Lecture 02.
All these parameters should be passed in via environment variables
from the docker-compose.yml script.
</p>

<p>
Here is what you need to do for this section.
  <ul>
  <li>I have provided in service.go an example to use the environment variable
  "POSTGRES_HOST" to pass the DNS name of the postgres service to the host parameter.
  Modify service.go accordingly to use environment variables to setup
  other parameters including dbName, user, and password.</li>
  <li>Modify docker-compose.yml to pass correct values to those environment variables.</li>
  <li>Build, create, and start the containers again to make sure your modification
  is correct. Take screenshots as needed.</li>
  <li>Test the key-value store using <span class="command">curl</span>
  and validate the log messages from the kvs service. Take screenshots as needed.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<hr><a name="environment" class="section">
IV. Fault Tolerance Testing</a>

<p>
What would you expect to happen if one of the services fails?
We test whether the key-value store continue to function
correctly or not if one service fails by shutting down and restarting them
one at a time. Here is a test procedure for the kvs service.
  <ol>
  <li>Put a key-value pair to the store.</li>
  <li>Shutdown kvs by <span class="command">docker kill ece573-prj02-kvs-1</span></li>
  <li>Restart kvs by <span class="command">docker compose start</span></li>
  <li>Validate that the key-value pair is still there.</li>
  </ol>
The test procedure for the 'postgres' service is more complicated since
the client may continue to connect to the 'kvs' service.
  <ol>
  <li>Put a key-value pair to the store.</li>
  <li>Shutdown postgres.</li>
  <li>Put another key-value pair to the store.</li>
  <li>Restart postgres.</li>
  <li>Are the two pairs still there?</li>
  <li>Shutdown and restart kvs.</li>
  <li>Are the two pairs still there?</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
Complete these two test procedures and take screenshots as needed.
Answer the following questions in the project report.
  <ul>
  <li>Is there any data loss if one service is down? Why?</li>
  <li>If there is, what would you like to do?</li>
  </ul>
</p>
