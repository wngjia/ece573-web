I. Objective</a>

<p>
In this project, you will learn basic steps to setup environments
for software development and deployment using virtual machines (VM)
and containers.
</p>

<hr><a name="vm" class="section">
II. Virtual Machine Setup</a>

<p>
Since our provisioning scripts use prebuilt binary packages and container images
that only run on x64 (Intel/AMD) processors,
we recommend to use a recent Windows computer with at least
4 CPU cores, 16GB memory, and 512GB SSD.
<span class="emph">
If you are using ARM-based computers (Apple MacBooks, Raspberry Pi's, etc.)
or your computers are more than 5 years old, please consider buying
a new Windows computer as mentioned earlier.
</span>
Alternatively, you may rent a x64 Ubuntu server from cloud providers
and follow instructions in the next section,
though we are not responsible for any cost incurred and we cannot
provide support for any tech issues.
</p>

<p>
Install the most recent version of
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> on your computer.
You will need to
<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-enable-hardware-virtualization-in-Windows-10-and-how-do-I-resolve-the-following-error-message-in-Android-Studio-1-3-1-%E2%80%9CHAX-kernel-module-is-not-installed%E2%80%9D">
turn on hardware virtualization</a>
if you haven't done so already.
</p>

<p>
Download the VM Appliance
<a href="https://iit0-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jwang34_illinoistech_edu/ESOIUoQg1LtNuwlZM-CjZHMBH8N-6N6WUE5-oZWCSxDuyA">
IIT-ECE573.ova</a>
and double-click to install/import. Make sure the file is downloaded
completely with the size of 1,744,280,576 bytes and verify the integrity if possible.
  <ul>
  <li>MD5:     7e3474b4eed8392bf8a235f54e14aefa </li>
  <li>SHA-256: 075186bdbf4bcc2988cce46acad38e993fcf8f84b35e801c6a0b5a0495390c01 </li>
  </ul>
Please keep this .ova file as we will need to use it throughout the semester
for other projects.
</p>

<p>
Choose the installed VM and click 'Settings'.
Choose 'Network' and click 'Advanced' from 'Adapter 1'.
Click 'Port Forwarding' to bring up 'Port Forwarding Rules'.
You should be able to see a mapping from 'Guest Port' 22
to 'Host Port' 57322. If not, you should setup the rule by yourself.
</p>

<p>
Start the VM. After a while, it would display the login screen.
While you could login here,
it is much more convenient to access the VM using SSH
as introduced next.
</p>

<hr><a name="server" class="section">
III. Ubuntu Server Setup</a>

<p>
Alternatively, if you are familiar with linux server administration and cloud computing,
you may use your own Ubuntu server or a Ubuntu server instance rented from a cloud provider.
Please follow the instructions below but be advised that
<span class="emph">
we are not responsible for any cost incurred and we cannot
provide support for any tech issues.
</span>
In addition, you will be required to use the VirtualBox VM above if issues persist.
<ol>
  <li>Prepare your server to have at least 4 CPU cores, 8GB memory, and 100GB storage.</li>
  <li>Install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS x64: for cloud instances, pick exactly this version;
  otherwise, download and install the Server install image from 
  <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/">here</a>.</li>
  <li>It is better to NOT use the root user directly.
  Create a user with a strong password. You may further
  disable the password and use SSH key pairs for best security.</li>
  <li>Figure out the IP address and the port for your Ubuntu server,
  follow the instructions in the next section to access the instance,
  then download and exectue our provisioning script.</li>
  <li>
  <span class="emph">
  To save the cost, you may destroy the instance once you are done with the project.
  </span>
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<hr><a name="ssh" class="section">
IV. Access Remote Instances via SSH</a>

<p>
Managing computing resources rented from a cloud provider,
e.g. a virtual private server (VPS), is not very different
from managing your VM that is currently running on your
own computer given you are using a proper set of tools.
In this section, we will introduce you to remote access
tools that depend on the SSH protocol.
These tools provide terminal access to instances
where you can execute shell commands.
Here are some tutorials that you should go through if you are not familiar
with Linux systems:
<ul>
  <li>
  Basic Linux usage: Chapter 1 to 8 from
  <a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/">Linux Tutorial</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
  Text editor: vi/Vim (<a href="https://linuxconfig.org/vim-tutorial">Vim Tutorial</a>)
  are prefered since they are available from most installations.
  Professionals also use Emacs that need to be installed first
  (<a href="https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Emacs-Beginner-HOWTO.html">Emacs
  Beginner's HOWTO</a>).
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a code editor that can be extended
into a powerful IDE by third-party extensions.
Download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> and install as necessary.
</p>

<p>
"Remote - SSH" is a widely used VS Code extension that makes it possible
to perform development tasks on a remote instance using your
favorite graphical user interface. You can follow
<a href=""https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh">
this link</a> to install it, or you can start VS Code
and search for it in the Extensions panel from the left.
</p>

<p>
Click the green "&gt;&lt;" button at the lower left corner
to access remote window options in VS Code. Choose "Connect to Host..."
and then enter "ubuntu@127.0.0.1:57322". A new VS Code window
will open and asks you for the password. Once you type the password
'ece573', you will be connected to the server. You can now
access files by opening a folder and execute commands
by opening a terminal. Sometimes you will need to type the password again.
</p>

<hr><a name="provision" class="section">
V. Instance Provisioning</a>

<p>
Our VM, like most of the instances rented from cloud,
only has a minimal set of software packages installed.
It is up to you to install and configure packages
as needed.
</p>

<p>
"Pets vs. Cattle" refers to a methodology shift of server
management for cloud computing from more traditional approaches.
Traditionally, physical servers are treated as "pets". Each server
has a particular role and their specific needs are met
by installing and configuring software packages individually.
Over the years, many of those packages will be updated
so it is possible that one may lose track of what packages
and what versions are actually installed.
As a consequence, it is critical to ensure the health of
these servers as it is very difficult to replace any.
</p>

<p>
Server management takes the "cattle" approach for cloud
computing so that a horde of servers can be easily
managed and replaced. In this approach, we no longer have
direct access to the physical server.
Instead, the underlying computing resources are accessed
via VM instances that can be created and destroyed.
All provisioning tasks including installing and configuring
software packages are automated by scripts. These scripts
are further stored in a version control system like Git so
that any instance can be reproduced exactly.
</p>

<p>
Clone the repository on GitHub that holds scripts and source
code for Project 1 by <span class="command">
git clone https://github.com/wngjia/ece573-prj01.git</span>.
<pre class="console">
ubuntu@ece573:~$ git clone https://github.com/wngjia/ece573-prj01.git
Cloning into 'ece573-prj01'...
...
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Provision the instance with the script <span class="command">
setup_vm.sh</span>.
<pre class="console">
ubuntu@ece573:~$ sudo ece573-prj01/setup_vm.sh
...
</pre>
It will take a while to complete and you may need to type
the password again.
</p>

<p>
Now two software packages, Docker and Go, should be properly
installed and configured, which can be verified
by <span class="command">go version</span>
and <span class="command">docker version</span>.
<pre class="console">
ubuntu@ece573:~$ go version
go version go1.21.0 linux/amd64
ubuntu@ece573:~$ docker version
Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           26.1.2

</pre>
</p>

VI. Docker and Go</a>

<p>
Using scripts to automatically setup VM instances
makes it possible to manage many instances efficiently.
However, VMs are considered "heavy" as they would need
to consume resources and take time to create and destroy.
Docker provides access to containers, which can be
treated as "lightweight virtual machines", that makes
the use of resources more effective.
</p>

<p>
Very similar to how we setup our VM instance, to use
Docker you will need to start with some "docker images"
that contain initial container setups. Then, you can
create your own images by modifying existing ones,
e.g. adding your own software.
What is the point of all these complexities instead
of just deploying your own software binary?
The point is that all these images can be easily
distributed to any instances supporting Docker
and be executed in containers there reproducing
the same behavior without the need to install
any other packages your software may be depending on.
In addition, once software packages are all deployed
using Docker, it is possible to reproduce production
environments in development settings, a very preferable
approach for software developement and testing.
</p>

<p>
Let's first obtain a docker image for building Go programs
by <span class="command">docker pull</span>
<pre class="console">
ubuntu@ece573:~$ docker pull golang:1.21
1.21: Pulling from library/golang
...
</pre>
It will take some time to download and Docker will verify
the integrity of the images.
You can then inspect the images
by <span class="command">docker images</span>
<pre class="console">
ubuntu@ece573:~$ docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
golang       1.21      3758cb2c0a6b   6 days ago       814MB
</pre>
Note that we have installed Go to our VM instance that will be
used by VS Code for Go development. This docker image is used
to build Go programs as releases for deployment into
testing and production environments.
</p>

<p>
The preferable way to create your own images is to use
a special script file named <span class="command">Dockerfile</span>.
Similar to VM instances, use of scripts ensures that
the images can be reproduced exactly if needed.
Build your first Docker image by <span class="command">docker build</span>.
You will need to supply a name for the image like "prj01"
by the <span class="command">-t prj01</span> option, and then
the directory <span class="command">ece573-prj01</span>
that contains the Dockerfile.
<pre class="console">
ubuntu@ece573:~$ docker build -t prj01 ece573-prj01
...
 => => writing image sha256:2317a9ea6fc78ded75b8d10198fe593fd383c05a93a22dcbe81b1dac069a9e72      0.0s
 => => naming to docker.io/library/prj01                                                          0.0s
ubuntu@ece573:~$ docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
prj01        latest    2317a9ea6fc7   33 minutes ago   1.82MB
golang       1.21      3758cb2c0a6b   6 days ago       814MB
</pre>
The newly built image "prj01" can be seen from
<span class="command">docker images</span> now.
It has a very small size of 1.82MB, which is about 1/1000
of our VM Appliance.
</p>

<p>
The Docker image can be executed in a container by
the <span class="command">docker run</span> command.
This is a complicated command that we will take time
to learn, but for now we simply use
the <span class="command">--rm</span> option
so the container will be removed at the end
without consuming any storage resources.
<pre class="console">
ubuntu@ece573:~$ docker run --rm prj01
Hello world!
</pre>
</p>

<hr><a name="report" class="section">
VII. Project Requirements and Deliverables</a>

<p>
You will need to complete all the steps above to setup
the VM instance correctly.
<span class="emph">
You should first complete Basic Linux usage: Chapter 1 to 8 from
<a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/">
Linux Tutorial</a> if you are not familiar with
basic Linux commands.
</span>
All commands use similar structures for inputs and outputs
so if anything goes wrong, you will need to read the outputs
carefully to understand what could be the problem -
usually it's a typo or a missing or extra space
somewhere in your typing.
</p>

<p>
Modify the file <span class="command">hello.go</span>
to print the date and time now as well as the last four digits
of your CWID. Build the docker image and execute it again.
The output should be something like follows:
<pre class="console">
ubuntu@ece573:~$ docker build -t prj01 ece573-prj01
...
 => => writing image sha256:6192b944ea4a53094535695b9e8903b330a634c174ac25009c5b7442ac4159b0      0.0s
 => => naming to docker.io/library/prj01                                                          0.0s
ubuntu@ece573:~$ docker run --rm prj01
Hello world!
It's 2023-08-15 21:15:42 now and my CWID ending in 1111.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Prepare a project report in .doc/.docs or .pdf format
and submit it to Canvas before the deadline.
Your project report should include the following:
<ul>
<li>
(5 points)
The lines you have added to <span class="command">hello.go</span>
to print the date and time now as well as the last four digits
of your CWID.
</li>
<li>
(5 points)
A screenshot showing the execution of the updated "prj01" image.
</li>
<li>
(10 points)
Provide answers to the following questions. You may need to
perform additional searches online to find the answers.
  <ul>
  <li>What do "pets" and "cattle" refer to?</li>
  <li>Why do we need to use <span class="command">sudo</span>
  when executing the script <span class="command">setup_vm.sh</span>?</li>
  <li>When we pull docker images, where on the Internet
  do the images come from?</li>
  <li>What is the difference between a docker image and a container?</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
